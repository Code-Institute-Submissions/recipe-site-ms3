### Color Scheme

I kept the color pallette very simple and clean because the content of the page is inevitably very colorful.

### Information Architecture
MongoDB Atlas is used for storing data for this web site.

Recipes Collection

```
"recipe":{
    "_id": "ObjectId()"
    "title": "<string>",
    "category_name": "<string>",
    "description": "<string>",
    "image_url": "<string>",
    "prep": "<string>",
    "cooks": "<string>",
    "difficulty": "<string>",
    "instructions": "<string>",
    "tips": "<string>",
    "date_added": "<string>",
}
```
Categories Collection
```
"categories":{
    "_id": "ObjectId()"
    "category_name": "<string>",
}
```
Users Collection
```
"users":{
    "_id": "ObjectId()"
    "user_name": "<string>",
    "email": "<string>",
    "password": "<string>",
}
```
Subscribers Collection
```
"subscribers":{
    "_id": "ObjectId()"
    "sub_email": "<string>",
}
```
For the needs of this website I did not find the need to use other data types in MongoDB.

## Deployment

### Local Development

This project can be ran locally by following the following steps:

Visit this [repository link](https://github.com/sabinemm/recipe-site-ms3.git) and click on the Clone or Download button to copy the link provided.

![clone](https://res.cloudinary.com/www-madine-se/image/upload/v1594582454/vegansite/Screenshot_2020-07-12_at_21.33.47_k4rvyg.png)

In your IDE, open a Terminal window and change to the directory where you want to clone this project and type:

Git clone [repository link](https://github.com/sabinemm/recipe-site-ms3.git)

After pressing Enter the project will be created and cloned locally.

(Alternatively you can download the zipped file, decompress it and use your IDE of choice to access it.)

Create a free account on MongoDb and reproduce the 4 collections as described [here](#Information-Architecture).

Make sure to upgrade PIP. 
```
pip install -U pip 
```

Install all dependencies
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Activate virtual environment 
```
source env/bin/activate
```
Create `.env` file with following data
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...
MONGO_DBNAME=yourdatabasename
SECRET_KEY=superdupersecret

```
add your .env file to .gitignore



You will then be able to run the app locally by typing python app.py or   flask run. 

### Heroku

Heroku was chosen as the deployment platform for this project. The steps to deploy the local app to Heroku were as follow:

In Heroku, created an app. The app must have a unique name.

Linked that app to the GitHub repository by going to the "Deploy" tab in the main app menu.


In the Settings tab, added the corresponding Config Variables as present in my local development:

```
MONGO_URI mongodb+srv://...
IP 0.0.0.0
PORT 5000
```

I also created a "Procfile" by typing 
```
echo web: python run.py > Procfile
```


After that process, the app was live and running remotely in Heroku's servers.
